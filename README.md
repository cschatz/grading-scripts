# Grading Scripts

This is a collection of scripts I wrote and use to partially automate grading of different kinds of
student work (e.g., Java, C++, web apps, etc). They interface with student grade records on Canvas, via the Canvas API, as well as a database used by (SciNet)[https://scinett.com/sn/] to track attendance and participation during class time.
